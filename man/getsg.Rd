\title{Compute Marginal Counts for Code Pairs}
\usage{
getsg(cooccur)
}
\arguments{
\item{cooccur}{A data frame or tibble with at least three columns: \code{code1}, \code{code2}, and \code{count}. \code{code1} and \code{code2} represent the codes being analyzed, while \code{count} represents the number of times each pair occurs.}
}
\value{
A list containing three components:
\describe{
\item{marg_word}{A data frame with marginal counts for \code{code1} (renamed to \code{code}) and their associated counts (\code{marg_count}).}
\item{marg_context}{A data frame with marginal counts for \code{code2} (renamed to \code{code}) and their associated counts (\code{marg_count}).}
\item{D}{The total sum of the \code{count} column across all rows in the input data frame.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the marginal counts for two sets of codes (\code{code1} and \code{code2}) based on a co-occurrence data frame. It returns the marginal sums for both sets of codes along with the total sum of counts in the dataset.

\examples{
# Example usage:
result <- getsg(cooccur)
